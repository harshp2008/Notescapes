# Introduction to bonds and structure

- Atoms are held together by **chemical bonds**
- The three main bonding models are:
	- ==ionic==
	- ==covalent== 
	- ==metallic== 
	- others include coordinate bonding.
- This leads to 4 structures, which are :
	- ==Ionic==
	- ==Molecular covalent==
	- ==Covalent network== 
	- ==Metallic==
- Covalent substances can be found in two arrangements:
	- A continuous 3D Network
	- Molecules (Discreet groups of atoms)
