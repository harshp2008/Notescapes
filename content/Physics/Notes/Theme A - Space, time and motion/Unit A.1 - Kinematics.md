# Describing Motion (Kinematics)

>[!info] Define Scalar
> - A scalar is a physical quantity that has size but no direction
> - Examples: 
> 	- Distance
> 	- Speed 
> 	- Work Done and Energy
> 	- Power
> 	- Mass
> 	- <u>Temperature</u>
> 	  (may have positive and negative values but still has **no inherit direction** thus it is a **scalar**)
> 	

>[!info] Define Vector
> - A vector is a physical quantity that has size and direction
> - <u>Examples:</u> 
> 	- Displacement
> 	- Velocity
> 	- Acceleration
> 	- Force
> 	- Time
> <br>
> - Any unit that relies on a vector quantity is a vector 
> - <u>Examples:</u>
> 	- Pressure = Force  / Area 
> 	- Force is a **Vector** and Area is a **Scalar**
> <br>
> 	- Momentum = Mass  * Velocity 
> 	- Mass  is a **Scalar** and Velocity is a **Vector**

## Defining kinematic quantities 


## Distance Vs Displacement

>[!info] Distance
> - The **total length of the path** an object takes, regardless of its starting or ending point.
> - Distance is a **scalar** quantity
> - Si unit is ==meter==
> - Distance is denoted with a ==" d "==


>[!info] Displacement 
>- The **change in position** of an object from its starting point to its ending point. 
>- Si unit is ==meter==
>- Displacement is a **vector** quantity.
>- Displacement can be found by drawing a straight line between two points
>- displacement is denoted with a ==" s "==

## Speed Vs Velocity

>[!info] Speed
> - Speed is the rate at which an object travels a **distance over time**
> - Si unit is ==m/s==.
> - Speed is a **scalar** quantity
> - Speed can be found by taking the gradient of a distance time graph
> - Speed is denoted by ==" _$v$_ "== (italics)
> <br>
> $Speed = \dfrac{\triangle distance }{\triangle time}$

>[!info] Velocity
>- Velocity is the rate at which an object changes its **displacement over time**.
>- Si unit is ==m/s==.
>- Velocity is a **vector** quantity.
>- Velocity can be found by taking the gradient of a Velocity time graph
>- Speed is denoted by ==" __$v$__ "== (bold)
><br>
>$veloctiy = \dfrac{ds}{dt}$

#### Average Speed vs Velocity

>[!info] Average Speed
>-  Average speed is the **total distance** travelled divided by the total time taken.
>- Average Speed is a **scalar**
>- Average speed is **always positive** and ==doesn't indicate the direction of motion==.
>- Can be found by taking the  area under a d-t graph and dividing by the time
><br>
>- $Average \space Speed = \dfrac{total \space distance}{time}$

>[!info] Average Velocity
>-  Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time.
>- Average Speed is a **vector**.
>- Can be found by taking the  area under a s-t graph and dividing by the time
><br>
>- $Average \space Velocity = \dfrac{displacement}{time} = \dfrac{\triangle \space position}{\triangle \space time}$
><br>
>- $Average \space Velocity = \dfrac{\triangle x_{final} - \triangle x_{initial}}{\triangle t_{final} - \triangle t_{initial}}$

#### Instantaneous Speed vs Velocity

>[!info] Instantaneous Speed
>-  Instantaneous speed is ==the speed of an object at a specific moment in time==
>- Instantaneous Speed is a **scalar**.
>- can be found by taking the gradient at a specific time value in a d-t graph
><br>
>- $Instantaneous \space Speed = \dfrac{distance \space travelled \space at \space time \space t}{t}$

>[!info] Instantaneous Velocity
>-  Instantaneous speed is ==the velocity of an object at a specific moment in time==
>- Instantaneous Speed is a **vector**.
>- can be found by taking the gradient at a specific time value in a s-t graph
><br>
>- $Instantaneous \space Velocity = \dfrac{displacement \space at \space t=T }{T}$
><br>
>- $Instantaneous \space Velocity = \lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\dfrac{ds}{dt}$

### Acceleration

>[!info] Acceleration
>Acceleration is the ==rate of change of velocity==
>Acceleration is a **vector**.
>Acceleration is written in $ms^{-2}$
><br>
><br>
>$acceleration = \dfrac{change \space in \space velocity}{time \space taken \space for \space the \space change}$
><br>
><br>
>$acceleration = \dfrac{d^2s}{dt^2} \space or \space \dfrac{dv}{dt}$

>[!info] Average Acceleration
> - Average Acceleration is the the overall change in velocity over the time taken for the overall change
> <br>
> - Can be found by taking the area under a v-t of a graph of a specific time period and dividing the area by the duration of that time period
> <br>
> <br>
> $Average \space Acceleration = \dfrac{overall \space change \space in \space velocity}{time \space taken \space for \space the \space overall \space change }$
> <br>
> <br>
> $Average \space Acceleration =\dfrac{ \int_{T_1}^{T_2}{\dfrac{dv}{dt} dt} }{T_2 - T_1}$
